##  Hello, I'm Daniel.

###  About Me : 

US Navy veteran (nuclear reactor operator) with Masters degree in Management Information Systems and 12 yearsâ€™ experience in business analysis, data engineering, enterprise data systems, data management, and stakeholder engagement, with a focus on end-to-end business process development, automating data products, and process solutions.

###  Current Focus :

* **Teaching:** Best way to deepen your own understanding is explaining it to someone else; I give trainings to upskill others and keep myself sharp
* **Refreshing on advanced math:** Linear algebra, differential calculus, statistics & econometrics, gotta carve out time to practice of they will fade
* **Amazon Web Services Certifications:** Knowing what to do is good, but the piece of paper that proves it is better
